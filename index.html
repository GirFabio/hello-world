<p align="justify"> My <b>research interests</b> lie in the intersection between <b>decision theory</b> and <b>financial economics</b>.
<br> I focus on how different sources of uncertainty affect the optimal decision-making of individual agents and, at the aggregate level, how financial markets compensate investors to bear different types of uncertainty.

<h2>Working Papers</h2>

<h3> "Ambiguity, Prudence and Optimal Portfolio" </h3>
<p align="justify">Abstract: Ambiguity prudence captures an aversion towards model uncertainty when favourable outcomes are less likely to realize and recent evidence suggests that such attitudes plays an important role in individual decision-making. I investigate the contribution of ambiguity prudence when an investor evaluates portfolio compositions according to the smooth model under ambiguity criterion. I derive a third-order approximation of the certainty equivalent to disentangle the contribution of preferences and beliefs. I analyse two relevant portfolio problems to show that ambiguity prudence puts non-linearities in the investor's marginal valuation that in turn might induce sizeable variation from the robust mean-variance solution. These effects emerge because of the investorâ€™s willingness to hedge against downside model uncertainty.</p>

<h3> "Consumption Sharing under Heterogeneous Beliefs and Ambiguity Attitudes" </h3>
<p align="justify">Abstract: This paper studies the optimal consumption allocation when investors have heterogeneous beliefs and ambiguity attitudes towards three sources of uncertainty: the first two concern the conditional distribution of consumption, while the third one concerns the persistence of the shocks hitting the economy. I provide a mechanism to explain why, as economic conditions deteriorate, subjective beliefs polarize. If the economy has a large number of periods, then disagreement over the persistent component of consumption becomes a main driver of the changes in the distribution of wealth. </p>
