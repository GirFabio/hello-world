<h3 id="Ambiguity, prudence and optimal portfolio"><a>Ambiguity, prudence and optimal portfolio.</a></h3>
<p>Abstract: Since Ellsberg, many studies have investigated the impact of model uncertainty on optimal portfolio allocations with a typical focus on ambiguity aversion. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that also ambiguity prudence plays an important role in decision-making. In this work, we investigate the contribution of ambiguity prudence when investor evaluates portfolio compositions according to the Smooth ambiguity criterion.  We derive a third-order approximation of the certainty equivalent to disentangle prudence effects among beliefs and behavioural attitudes. Later on, we focus on two relevant examples: in the first, returns are i.i.d. with unknown expected return over which investor attaches skewed beliefs. In the second one, investor is ambiguous about excess-returns predictability. We show that, when the certainty equivalents implied by the models under evaluation are significantly different, ambiguity prudence induces a reduction of stock allocation because of the investor's willingness to hedge against downside model uncertainty.</p>

<h3 id="Optimal allocations under heterogeneous beliefs and ambiguity attitudes">Optimal allocations under heterogeneous beliefs and ambiguity attitudes.</h3>
<p>Abstract: This paper provides a preliminary analysis of the Pareto optimal allocations when investors have both heterogeneous beliefs and attitudes towards ambiguity. Specifically, I assume investors face two sources of model uncertainty: the first one concerns the persistence of the shocks hitting the economy, while the second one is about the conditional distribution of the fundamental. I provide a mechanism to explain why, as economic condition deteriorate, subjective beliefs polarize and disagreement spikes. The changes in wealth distribution, due to the heterogeneous characteristics of the investors, might help to explain several asset pricing puzzles, e.g. why returns are more predictable during bad times.</p>
