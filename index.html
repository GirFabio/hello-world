<p>Abstract: Since Ellsberg, many studies have investigated the impact of model uncertainty on optimal portfolio allocations with a typical focus on ambiguity aversion. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that also ambiguity prudence plays an important role in decision-making. In this work, we investigate the contribution of ambiguity prudence when investor evaluates portfolio compositions according to the Smooth ambiguity criterion.  We derive a third-order approximation of the certainty equivalent to disentangle prudence effects among beliefs and behavioural attitudes. Later on, we focus on two relevant examples: in the first, returns are i.i.d. with unknown expected return over which investor attaches skewed beliefs. In the second one, investor is ambiguous about excess-returns predictability. We show that, when the certainty equivalents implied by the models under evaluation are significantly different, ambiguity prudence induces a reduction of stock allocation because of the investor's willingness to hedge against downside model uncertainty.</p>
