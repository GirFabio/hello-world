<h3 id="Ambiguity, Prudence and Optimal Portfolio"></h3>
<p>Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests that ambiguity prudence plays an important role in decision-making. In this work, I investigate the contribution of ambiguity prudence when an investor evaluates portfolio compositions according to the Smooth ambiguity criterion. I derive a third-order approximation of the certainty equivalent that disentangles prudence effects among beliefs and behavioural attitudes. I analyse two relevant portfolio problems to show that, when the certainty equivalents implied by models under evaluation are significantly different, ambiguity prudence might induce sizeable non-linearities in the optimal stock allocations. These effects emerge because of the investorâ€™s willingness to hedge against downside model uncertainty.</p>

<p><em>(with Eleonora Patacchini and Paolo Pin)</em></p>
<p>Abstract: Using an app for smartphones we run an experiment among high school students to study the pattern of aggregation of sparsely distributed information when competing agents are arranged in small networks and can share only non-verifiable pieces of information. Our first finding is that the level of cooperation is high, especially among students that belong to the same class. Nevertheless the level of centralization of the network significantly affects the final results, with the most central node benefiting in terms of payoffs. By adding a second node with a high centrality we see that the results change significantly, with more signals traveling through the links. We then turn to a parsimonious level-k approach to characterize players according to their behavior in the game. When estimating the model we see that data are consistent with a vast majority of players acting cooperatively, with the difference across networks driven mainly by a small share of strategic players and their position in the network.</p>
