<p>Abstract: Since Ellsberg, many studies have investigated the impact of model un-
certainty on optimal portfolio allocations with a typical focus on ambiguity
aversion. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that also ambi-
guity prudence plays an important role in decision-making. In this work,
we investigate the contribution of ambiguity prudence when investor eval-
uates portfolio compositions according to the Smooth ambiguity criterion.
We derive a third-order approximation of the certainty equivalent to dis-
entangle prudence eects among beliefs and behavioural attitudes. Later
on, we focus on two relevant examples: in the first, returns are i.i.d. with
unknown expected return over which investor attaches skewed beliefs. In
the second one, investor is ambiguous about excess-returns predictability.
We show that, when the certainty equivalents implied by the models under
evaluation are significantly different, ambiguity prudence induces a reduc-
tion of stock allocation because of the investor's willingness to hedge against
downside model uncertainty.</p>
